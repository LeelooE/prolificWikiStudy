                  <p>A hanok (Korean: 한옥, 韓屋) is a traditional Korean house. Hanoks were first designed and built in the 14th century during the Joseon Dynasty.Korean architecture considers the positioning of the house in relation to its surroundings, with thought given to the land and seasons. The interior of the house is also planned accordingly. This principle is called baesanimsu (Hangul: 배산임수; Hanja: 背山臨水), meaning that the ideal house is built with a mountain in the back and a river in the front. Hanok shapes differ by region. In the cold northern regions of Korea, hanoks are built in a square with a courtyard in the middle in order to retain heat better. In the south, hanoks are more open and L-shaped.</p><h2>Term</h2><p>According to old paper about house in April 23 of 1907, the terms that Hanok appeared on the history for the first time. In that paper, Hanok was figure out the specific region where Jeong-dongroad, from Donuimun to Baejae school. At that time, instead of using Hanok, terms like 'Jooga'(It means living houses), 'Jaetaek' (meaning a variety of houses) were used widespread. The word, 'Hanok', was only used in special circumstance when the latest house was built in somewhere.
During the era of Korea under Japanese rule, the ruler used terms such as 'Jooga' or 'Joseon House' when they were talking about house improvement. There was a record about hanok; however, the specific term ‘hanok’ hasn't been used prevalently.
The specific word ‘hanok’ appeared in the Samsung Korean big dictionary in 1975, where it was defined as an antonym of western house and as a term meaning Joseon house (Korean-style house). After the 1970s, with urban development, many apartments and row Houses were built in South Korea, and many Hanoks were demolished in every town. From that time on, a hanok was only called a ‘’Korean traditional house.’’ In a broad sense, ‘hanok’ refers to a house with thatching or to a Neowa-jib (a shingle-roofed house) or a Giwa-jib (tile-roofed house), although the general meaning of ‘hanok’ refers to only a Giwa-jib (tile-roofed house) in Korea.</p><a href='question1.html'><button>Finished reading?
